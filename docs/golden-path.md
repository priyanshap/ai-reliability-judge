# Golden-path demo: AI Reliability Judge
For the demo, we always start from this repo:

https://github.com/priyanshap/ai-reliability-judge

Why this repo?
- It is our own AI Reliability Judge project, built specifically to evaluate AI agents.  
- It has a realistic setup with evaluation logic, GitHub integration, and a clean UI, so the score and auto-fix PR tell a meaningful story.

Demo flow:
1. Paste the default URL that we have used for the demo: `https://github.com/priyanshap/ai-reliability-judge`.
2. Click **"Run reliability evaluation"**.
3. Wait for the score and reliability breakdown table.
4. Open the suggested GitHub PR to see how AI Reliability Judge proposes to harden the agent.
