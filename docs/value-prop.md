# One-liner
AI Reliability Judge is a reliability and auto-fix layer for AI agents: paste a repo, stress-test the agent, get a 0–100 trust score, and receive an AI-generated GitHub PR with fixes. 
# Problem
Teams ship AI agents into production without a clear sense of reliability. Bugs only surface as incidents, and there is no standard way to measure trustworthiness across repos and versions. 

# Solution
Our tool runs scenario-based evaluations against any public AI agent repo, scores reliability across five dimensions, and auto-opens a GitHub PR with suggested changes (tests, guardrails, logging, config). This turns “agent reliability” from a vague feeling into a concrete CI-ready signal.

- Who is this for?  
  - “Founders, PMs, and engineers who need to prove their AI agents won’t break in production.”

- What does it do?  
  - “Stress-test your agent with realistic tasks, compute a reliability score, and auto-generate GitHub PRs that harden your repo.”

- Why now?  
  - “As AI agents move from demos to production workflows, teams need a reliability standard the same way they rely on test coverage and monitoring today.”
