## 30-second intro
“Hi, I’m Priyansha, and this is AI Reliability Judge.

Today, anyone can ship an AI agent just by wiring tools to an LLM. What’s missing is a simple way to answer one question: ‘Can we trust this version enough to ship it?’

AI Reliability Judge is a web app where you paste a GitHub repo for an agent, and in one click you get a reliability score from 0 to 100, a breakdown of what failed, and even an auto-generated GitHub pull request with fixes.”

## 30-second outro
“So that’s AI Reliability Judge.

Instead of guessing whether an agent is ready, teams and judges see a concrete reliability score, a clear test breakdown, and a PR they can merge.

If this existed in every agent CI pipeline, a lot fewer flaky, silent-failing agents would reach users. We’d love your feedback on which reliability dimensions you’d like to see next.”
